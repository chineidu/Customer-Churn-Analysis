# Customer Churn Prediction

Churn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period. It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate). In general, customer churn (customer attrition) prediction is the process of determining customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a common business problem.
